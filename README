== Overview ==

This plugin is a Doctrine port of [wiki:sfSimpleCMSPlugin]. It is currently considered to be in an alpha state. It is not yet thoroughly tested.

It allows you to add a simple Content Management System (CMS) to your symfony application with the following features:
  - Uses Javascript and Ajax to provide a neat user experience
  - Edit zones in pages
  - Edit page URL (you can use / in page path)
  - Edit content in the real context ('edit in place')
  - Preview result
  - Create and manage a tree structure for pages
  - i18n ready (the interface is translated)
  - l10n ready (a page can have different versions)
  - support multiple templates
  - Basic publication workflow
  - Breadcrumb navigation  
  - Edit locking
  - User management is controlled through [wiki:sfGuardDoctrinePlugin]  

It is not aimed at replacing full-featured CMS packages, but offers a lightweight alternative for when you build a website that has to contain pages often updated by special users. It is voluntarily simple, and very easy to configure; so it should fulfill most basic CMS requirements.

Please note that this plugin is in active development. If you want to help and improve it, please contact Magnus Nordlander ( magnus@smilingplants.com ).

This README is very incomplete. A lot of what is in the README for [wiki:sfSimpleCMSPlugin] applies. Configuration is similar to sfSimpleCMSPlugin as well, although there are a few additional options.

== Requirements ==

The prerequisites for using the `sfDoctrineSimpleCMS` plugin are:

 - [wiki:sfDoctrine]
 - [wiki:sfGuardDoctrinePlugin]
 - Rich text editing uses tinyMCE. You must install tinyMCE if you want a wysiwyg interface for text editing.
 
To install the plugin for a symfony project, the currently only way is to check it out from the subversion repository.
